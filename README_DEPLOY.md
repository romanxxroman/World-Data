World Data â€” Local Deploy (Docker Compose)
=========================================

This package provides a minimal, ready-to-run skeleton for World Data.

Default admin credentials (change immediately):
- Admin username: admin
- Admin password: uAa3qBYjr33XS-8LjDlceA

How to run:
1. Unzip and cd into the folder.
2. docker compose up --build
3. Open http://localhost:8000

Notes:
- Change ADMIN_PASSWORD env or update in DB after first run.
- This skeleton is functional but minimal: search, create person, upload file endpoints.
